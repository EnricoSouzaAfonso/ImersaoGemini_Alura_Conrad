## About the Project

Conrad was born from the idea of making learning more accessible, interactive, and tailored to individual needs. Its mission is not just to provide answers, but to guide users through a process of discovery, using a Socratic and constructivist approach to help build a deep understanding of any subject.

Whether you are a curious student, a professional seeking new knowledge, or someone who simply loves to learn, Conrad is here to help you explore everything from basic everyday concepts to complex theories like the Drake Equation.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface in Colab:** A rich and friendly chat experience created with `ipywidgets`, styled with CSS, and enhanced with JavaScript, all within a notebook.
- **Socratic Pedagogy:** Conrad strives to ask questions and use analogies to guide reasoning, rather than just providing direct answers.
- **Dynamic Multilingual Support:** Detects the user's language and adapts its responses to maintain a fluid and natural conversation.
- **Advanced Code Generation:**
    - Code blocks with automatic **syntax highlighting** for hundreds of languages.
    - **Copy** and **Download** buttons for each code snippet.
    - A visual indicator of the detected programming language.
- **AI Model Customization:** Includes a utility cell to list available Gemini models and allows for easy replacement of the default model.
- **Visible Context Management:** A token counter informs the user about the conversation's context window usage, helping to manage longer learning sessions.
- **Empathetic and Patient Persona:** Designed to recognize user frustration, validate their feelings, and proactively suggest new learning strategies.

1.  **Get your Google Gemini API Key:**
    - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    - Click on "**Get API key**" and create a new key.
    - **Copy and save this key**, you will need it in step 3.

2.  **Open the Project in Google Colab:**
    - Click the button below to open the notebook directly in Google Colab.
      [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EnricoSouzaAfonso/ImersaoGemini_Alura_Conrad/blob/main/Conrad.ipynb)

3.  **Configure the API Key:**
    - In the Google Colab notebook you opened, click on the **key icon (Secrets)** in the left sidebar.
    - Create a new secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
    - In the "Value" field, paste the API Key you obtained in step 1.
    - Make sure the "Notebook access" toggle is enabled for this secret.

4.  **Run the Cells:**
    - **Cell 1 (`!pip install`):** Run this first to install all the necessary dependencies.
    - **Cell 2 (Initial Setup):** Run this to import the libraries and configure the API Key.

## Advanced Customization

Conrad is designed to be flexible.

### Altering the AI Model

If you want to try a different Gemini model (e.g., a Pro model or a newer version), you can use **Cell 3 (List Available Models)**.

1.  Run Cell 3.
2.  It will list all models available to your API Key, with their technical names and limits.
3.  Copy the `Technical Name` of the desired model (e.g., `models/gemini-2.5-pro`).
4.  In **Cell 2**, paste this name into the `model_name_conrad` variable.
5.  Rerun Cell 2 and Cell 4 to start the chat with the new model.

### Adjusting Conrad's Personality

Conrad's personality, rules, and all teaching strategies are defined in the `system_instruction_conrad` variable at the top of **Cell 4**. You can edit this long text to adjust its behavior, tone, or even add new rules and abilities.
